# C++ Data Structures and OOP Projects

This repository contains organized C++ programming exercises demonstrating object-oriented design, data structures, and core algorithmic concepts.

## Topics Covered

- Basic input/output and control flow
- Functions and modular design
- Classes and object-oriented programming
- Operator overloading
- Dynamic memory management
- Linked data structures
- Searching and sorting algorithms
- Mathematical and financial modeling programs

## Structure

Programs are organized into topic-based folders reflecting progression through core C++ concepts.

Emphasis is placed on:

- Class abstraction and encapsulation
- Memory management using pointers
- Data structure implementation
- Clean modular program design

## Compilation

Programs were compiled using a standard C++ compiler:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o outputname
./outputname
